The features selected for the original database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain 
signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a 
corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal were then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals 
using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were 
derived in time to obtain Jerk signals. Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm 
Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing the frequency domain signals. 

These signals were obtained from a group of 30 subjects within an age bracket of 19-48 years, with each person performing six activities 
(WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on their waist.
