The features selected for the original database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and 
tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter 
and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration 
signal were then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner 
frequency of 0.3 Hz. Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk 
signals. Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm. 
Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing the frequency domain signals. 

These signals were obtained from a group of 30 subjects within an age bracket of 19-48 years, with each person performing 
six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone 
(Samsung Galaxy S II) on their waist.
